# Expense List

A simple expense list web application. A solution to [Engage Technology Partners](http://www.engagetech.com/) [Backend Coding Challenge](https://github.com/engagetech/backend-coding-challenge).

# Developer Documentation
The application is written in [Java](http://openjdk.java.net/) using the [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) framework and is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

This repository includes [Gradle's Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) for running and testing the application so no need to install any additional tooling to run or test this application.
